# Built-in Benchmarks

Built-in benchmark experiments provide standard mathematical optimization functions for testing, validating, and comparing optimization algorithms. These carefully chosen benchmarks represent different optimization challenges and are essential for understanding algorithm behavior.

## Why Use Benchmarks?

- **Algorithm Testing**: Validate optimization performance on known problems
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare different optimizers on standardized tests  
- **Research Validation**: Use established benchmarks for reproducible research
- **Learning Tool**: Understand optimization concepts with well-documented functions
