# Sphere Function

## Introduction

The Sphere function is one of the simplest and most fundamental benchmark functions in optimization. It represents a convex, unimodal function with a single global minimum, making it ideal for testing basic convergence properties of optimization algorithms.

## Mathematical Definition

The Sphere function is defined as:

$$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2$$

Where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem.

## Properties

- **Global minimum**: $f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0$
- **Search domain**: Typically $[-5.12, 5.12]^d$ or $[-10, 10]^d$
- **Unimodal**: Single global minimum, no local minima
- **Separable**: Each variable contributes independently
- **Convex**: Bowl-shaped surface
- **Differentiable**: Smooth everywhere
- **Scalable**: Can be used in any dimension

## Usage Example



## Characteristics for Algorithm Testing

### What the Sphere Function Tests

1. **Basic Convergence**: Can the algorithm find the global minimum?
2. **Convergence Rate**: How quickly does it converge?
3. **Precision**: How close can it get to the exact optimum?
4. **Scalability**: Performance vs dimensionality relationship
5. **Consistency**: Reliable performance across runs

### Expected Algorithm Performance

- **Gradient-based methods**: Excellent, direct path to optimum
- **Hill Climbing**: Very good, steady improvement
- **Random Search**: Slow but eventually successful
- **Population methods**: Good, may be overkill for this simple function
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Excellent, very sample-efficient

## Theoretical Properties

### Gradient Information
The gradient of the sphere function is:
$$\nabla f(x) = 2x$$

This means:
- Gradient points directly away from the origin
- Magnitude increases linearly with distance from origin
- Steepest descent leads directly to the global minimum

### Hessian Matrix
The Hessian is:
$$H = 2I$$

Where $I$ is the identity matrix, indicating:
- Constant curvature in all directions
- No interaction between variables
- Well-conditioned optimization problem

## Performance Baselines

For the sphere function, expect these approximate performance characteristics:

- **Random Search**: $O(d)$ evaluations to get within reasonable distance
- **Hill Climbing**: $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for precision $\epsilon$
- **Gradient Methods**: Quadratic convergence
- **Population Methods**: May require more evaluations but very reliable

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-engineering**: Using complex algorithms on this simple function
2. **Insufficient precision**: Stopping optimization too early
3. **Wrong bounds**: Using bounds that don't include the global minimum
4. **Ignoring scaling**: Not accounting for dimension-dependent difficulty
