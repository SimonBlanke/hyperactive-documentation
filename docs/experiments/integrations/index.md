# Framework Integrations

Integration experiments provide seamless optimization workflows for popular machine learning and data science frameworks. These specialized experiments handle the complexity of framework-specific optimization while maintaining Hyperactive's consistent API.

## Why Use Integrations?

- **Native Framework Support**: Optimized workflows designed for specific ML frameworks
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Pre-built experiment templates eliminate setup complexity
- **Best Practices**: Implementations follow framework conventions and optimization patterns
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested integrations suitable for real-world applications
