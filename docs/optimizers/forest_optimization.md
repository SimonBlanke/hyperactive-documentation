# Forest Optimization

## Introduction

The forest-optimizer calculates the expected improvement of the position space with a 
tree-based model. This optimization technique is very similar to bayesian-optimization
in every part, except its surrogate model.

## About the implementation

The forest-optimizer shares most of its code base with the bayesian-optimizer. Only its model to 
calculate the expected score $\mu$ and its standard deviation $\sigma$ is different. Tree based models do not 
calculate the standard deviation by them self. A modification is necessary to determine the
standard deviation from the impurity of the trees in the ensemble. This modification is taken from the paper *"Algorithm Runtime Prediction: Methods & Evaluation"* chapter *4.3.3*.
