# NSGA-II Optimizer

## Introduction

NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm designed for problems with multiple conflicting objectives. It's particularly effective for Pareto optimization problems.

## Usage Example



## When to Use NSGA-II

**Best for:**
- Multi-objective optimization
- Pareto front exploration
- Conflicting objectives (accuracy vs speed, performance vs complexity)
- Population-based search

**Parameters:**
- `population_size`: Size of the population (default: 50)
- `mutation_prob`: Probability of mutation
- `crossover_prob`: Probability of crossover
