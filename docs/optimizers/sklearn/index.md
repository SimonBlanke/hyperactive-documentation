# Scikit-learn Backend

The Scikit-learn backend provides direct integration with sklearn's trusted optimization methods. If you're already using sklearn workflows, this backend offers the familiar GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV through Hyperactive's consistent interface.

## Why Choose Sklearn?

- **Zero Learning Curve**: Same GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV you already know
- **Perfect Sklearn Integration**: Native compatibility with all sklearn estimators and pipelines
- **Battle-Tested Reliability**: Leverage sklearn's mature, well-tested implementations
- **Familiar Parameter Syntax**: Use the same parameter specifications you're used to
- **Built-in Cross-Validation**: Native CV integration without additional setup
