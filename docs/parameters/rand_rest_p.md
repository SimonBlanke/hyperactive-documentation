### `rand_rest_p`

Probability for the optimization algorithm to jump to a random position in an iteration step. It is set to 0 per default. The idea of this parameter is to give the possibility to inject randomness into algorithms that don't normally support it.


  - **type**: float
  - **default**: 0
  - **typical range**: 0.01 ... 0.1
